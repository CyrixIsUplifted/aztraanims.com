                    If we're not good at something, then we should learn and practice so that we can excel.

                <h2>Hello! I'm Cyrix Brent M. Celis!</h2>
                <p>I'm a full-time writer, artist, animator, game-developer, musician, and currently a student.
                My dream is to become a professional software developer and also an author. Ever since I was a kid,
                I always love to read books and novels. Every time I see a book, I can't help but skim on it until
                time passes by. Because of that, I learned how to write my own stories, which led me to become a part-time
                author in the present. Developing a game, animating and drawing characters, and composing music has been part
                of my daily life as well. My whole time revolves around artistic hobbies and creative instances. But despite
                having many hobbies, I can still help my parents with my responsibilities. In order to be successful, I need
                to be productive every day.
